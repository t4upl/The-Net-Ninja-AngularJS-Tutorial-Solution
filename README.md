# The-Net-Ninja-AngularJS-Tutorial-Solution
Full code from The Net Ninja's AngularJS Tutorial course. One commit per video.
## Inspiration
This repository contains full code for Angular JS video tutorial created by The Net Ninja with some minor tweaks as suggested by comments. Some tweaks were required in order to get the same results as presented in video.  Repository provided by The Net Ninja contains only core files so I thought it might be a good idea to publish full code (solution) in case somebody working with the tutorial got stuck.

As general rule there is one commit per video starting from part 10 of tutorial.

## Getting started

1. Download Atom IDE.
2. Download atom-live-server package.
3. Download this github repository.
4. Open folder with github repository from inside the atom IDE and run the live server.
5. AngularJS application should be displayed inside a new tab in the internet browser.

## Note (Important!)
Video 25 from tutorial (the last one) tends to be moody and sometime is not working on the first try. If the problem were to persist checkout tag <kbd>step24</kbd>. This would reset the working tree to the repository with a state at the end of video 24 from tutorial where everything should be fine.

## Acknowledgement
Kudos to The Net Ninja for creating very good and coherent tutorial. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gsJS5QgFT2IvWIX78dV3_v).
